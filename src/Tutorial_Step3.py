# First access the VTK module (and any other needed modules) by importing them.
import vtk


def main(argv):
    colors = vtk.vtkNamedColors()

    #
    # Next we create an instance of vtkConeSource and set some of its
    # properties. The instance of vtkConeSource 'cone' is part of a
    # visualization pipeline (it is a source process object) it produces data
    # (output type is vtkPolyData) which other filters may process.
    #
    cone = vtk.vtkConeSource()
    cone.SetHeight(3.0)
    cone.SetRadius(1.0)
    cone.SetResolution(10)

    #
    # In this example we terminate the pipeline with a mapper process object.
    # (Intermediate filters such as vtkShrinkPolyData could be inserted in
    # between the source and the mapper.)  We create an instance of
    # vtkPolyDataMapper to map the polygonal data into graphics primitives. We
    # connect the output of the cone source to the input of this mapper.
    #
    coneMapper = vtk.vtkPolyDataMapper()
    coneMapper.SetInputConnection(cone.GetOutputPort())

    #
    # Create an actor to represent the cone. The actor orchestrates rendering
    # of the mapper's graphics primitives. An actor also refers to properties
    # via a vtkProperty instance, and includes an internal transformation
    # matrix. We set this actor's mapper to be coneMapper which we created
    # above.
    #
    coneActor = vtk.vtkActor()
    coneActor.SetMapper(coneMapper)
    coneActor.GetProperty().SetColor(colors.GetColor3d('MistyRose'))

    #
    # Create two renderers and assign actors to them. A renderer renders into
    # a viewport within the vtkRenderWindow. It is part or all of a window on
    # the screen and it is responsible for drawing the actors it has.  We also
    # set the background color here. In this example we are adding the same
    # actor to two different renderers it is okay to add different actors to
    # different renderers as well.
    #
    ren1 = vtk.vtkRenderer()
    ren1.AddActor(coneActor)
    ren1.SetBackground(colors.GetColor3d('RoyalBlue'))

    ren1.SetViewport(0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0)

    ren2 = vtk.vtkRenderer()
    ren2.AddActor(coneActor)
    ren2.SetBackground(colors.GetColor3d('DodgerBlue'))
    ren2.SetViewport(0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0)

    #
    # Finally we create the render window which will show up on the screen.
    # We put our renderer into the render window using AddRenderer. We also
    # set the size to be 300 pixels by 300.
    #
    renWin = vtk.vtkRenderWindow()
    renWin.AddRenderer(ren1)
    renWin.AddRenderer(ren2)
    renWin.SetSize(600, 300)
    renWin.SetWindowName('Tutorial_Step3')

    #
    # Make one view 90 degrees from other.
    #
    ren1.ResetCamera()
    ren1.GetActiveCamera().Azimuth(90)

    #
    # Now we loop over 360 degrees and render the cones each time.
    #
    for i in range(0, 360):  # render the image
        renWin.Render()
        # rotate the active camera by one degree
        ren1.GetActiveCamera().Azimuth(1)
